This project was bootstrapped with Create React App --typescript.

The repository contains a simple Typescript x React boilerplate, including my Typescript configuration. Feel free to use your own.

I am also providing a useState hook example in `SampleContext.tsx`, which is a Higher-Order Component (I decided not to use the useContext hook).

## Get it up and running

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
